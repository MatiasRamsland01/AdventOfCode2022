# AdventOfCode2022
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other

Personally i have used dotnet (C#) to further develop my skills.

Each day have a folder and inside each folder you can find the task description and my solution to the task.
